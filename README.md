# Ransomware Simulation UI

Originally built for Mission 1 and now updated in Mission 2 with basic JavaScript interactivity.

A simple HTML, CSS and now JS project built for the Mission Ready Diploma.  
Purpose was to simulate a ransomware lock screen to show how front-end design can represent cybersecurity concepts.

## What Was Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (added in Mission 2)
- VS Code
- W3S

## What I Practiced
- Basic HTML structure and form elements
- CSS styling and layout control
- Using design to create a specific tone or message
- Mission 2 update: added simple interactivity with JavaScript including input validation, messaging, and dynamic feedback

## Notes
This is a front-end only simulation for learning purposes.  
No real encryption or backend code included 😂  
Mission 2 added some very basic logic to “restore data” based on fake credentials.

## Version
v1.0 – Initial static release  
v2.0 – Mission 2 update adding JavaScript behaviour and feedback
